# Designing the ATM System

Before begin the ATM system’s design. A system is a set of components that interact to solve a problem. To perform the ATM system’s designated tasks, our ATM system has a user interface, contains software that executes financial transactions and interacts with a database of bank account information. System structure describes the system’s objects and their interrelationships. System behavior describes how the system changes as its objects interact with one another. Every system has both structure and behavior designers must specify both. There are several distinct types of system structures and behaviors. For example, the interactions among objects in the system differ from those between the user and the system, yet both constitute a portion of the system behavior. <br />
